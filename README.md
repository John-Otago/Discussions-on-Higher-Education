# Discussions and Debates on Higher Education

Version: 0.1.1  
Last update: 2 June 2021

This is a collection of relevant discussions on tertiary education, mostly from the two publications I read regularly: *Times Higher Education* (UK-based with global coverage) and *The Chronicle of Higher Education* (US-based with mainly local coverage). There are a few other sources, too.

It started as a personal collection that I put in a digital notebook, together with many other magazine and newspaper articles, but gradually I realised the benefits of sharing my collection with colleagues and students as well as the wider community. Simply collecting and hoarding these resources create little value; sharing them does.

I always endeavour to collect a diverse range of opinions and reports, so I won't end up in a limited echo chamber, although we are all (to various degrees) subject to cognitive biases and may be unconsciously inclined to the opinions that align with our existing knowledge and beliefs. 

Some commentaries I have collected may be subject to the same issues, and some news reports and opinion pieces may be driven by underlying ideological agendas (no matter which side of the cultural, political, and economic spectrum they come from). My reliance on a small range of publications may also limit the scope of this collection.

Nonetheless, I consider this collection a service to the academic community and wider society to foster further discussion, and to encourage my students to consider relevant issues as part of their education. This collection also serves as a list of references on the important issues that are under debate in tertiary education.

The collection was first released in June 2021, although I have been reading and thinking about these issues for years since at least 2015 (I will add past resources where possible and relevant). The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated many existing trends and changes that were already underway; it is more important than ever to rethink the role of and our approaches to higher education. 

Putting together this collection with regular updates is time-consuming and can be physically and emotionally exhausting. I do not necessarily agree with everything collected here (some of them actually contradict each other), and many issues facing us are highly complicated if not politically sensitive. I don't like polarisation and hope we can find a way to talk to each other for better social cohesion to address the common challenges facing us—that's the purpose of this collection for informed discussion.
