# Discussions (and Debates) on Higher Education

Version: 2.2.11  
Last update: 20 Feb 2022

Compiled by J.W.

This is a curated collection of relevant discussions on tertiary education, mostly from the two publications I read regularly: *Times Higher Education* (UK-based with global coverage) and *The Chronicle of Higher Education* (US-based with mainly local coverage). There are a few other sources, too.

It started as a personal collection before I realised the benefits of sharing my collection with colleagues and students as well as the wider community. Simply collecting and hoarding these resources create little value; sharing them does.

I always endeavour to collect a diverse range of opinions and reports, so I won't end up in an echo chamber, although we are all (to various degrees) subject to biases and may be unconsciously inclined to the opinions that align with our existing knowledge and beliefs. My reliance on a small range of publications may also limit the scope of this collection.

Nonetheless, I consider this collection a service to the academic community and wider society to foster further discussion, and to encourage my students to consider relevant issues as part of their education. This collection also serves as a list of references on the important issues that are under debate in tertiary education.

The collection was first released in 2021, although I have been collecting relevant publications for years (I will add past resources where possible and relevant). The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated many existing trends and changes that were already underway; it is more important than ever to rethink the role of and our approaches to higher education. 

Putting together this collection with regular updates is time-consuming and can be physically and emotionally exhausting. I do not necessarily agree with everything collected here, and many issues facing us are highly complicated and politically sensitive. I don't like polarisation and hope we can find a way to talk to each other for better social cohesion to address the common challenges facing us—that's the purpose of this collection for informed discussion.

For graduate students, [04 The Academic Job Market](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education#04-the-academic-job-market) would be a useful section. Also consult my [PhD+ Project](https://github.com/John-Otago/PhD-Plus/blob/main/README.md) for more resources & advice. 

[Section 06 Research and Publication](https://github.com/John-Otago/Discussions-on-Higher-Education/blob/main/README.md#06-research-and-publication) may also help students and early-career researchers. Check out my project [Selected Journals in HASS](https://github.com/John-Otago/Selected-Journals-in-HASS) as well.

Note that some publications are behind a paywall (your institution may have subscriptions).

- Section 7 no longer includes specific reports on emerging countries (too many) to keep the focus on major international trends.

## 08 Relevant Books
**The New PhD: How to Build a Better Graduate Education** || L Cassuto & R Weisbuch || 2021 || Johns Hopkins UP || https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/new-phd  
>*Note: I've read the Introduction and Chapters 1, 3, and 7-10.*  
>- Introduction: the big picture, including the collapsed academic job markets for PhD graduates.
>- Chap 1: a very good summary of past attempts in the US since 1990.
>- Chap 3: important but the suggested approaches (e.g. workshops/courses and career counselling) are a bit cliche; internship sounds great but will add time; I doubt if a 'time neutral' approach (p. 129) really exists to prepare PhD students for diverse careers (more preparation = more time); 'without lengthening an already long time to degree' probably means students need to work longer hours within the overall timeframe to prepare for non-academic careers in addition to conducting academic research, or they need to significantly increase their productivity, or both (longer hours + increased productivity).
>- Chap 7: the first part doesn't seem to be relevant; I also disagree that '[t]he literature that analyzes graduate student advising is scant' (p. 225; this is a heavily researched area in Education, albeit seldom on career diversity per se); the rest of the chapter offers good advice--these methods inevitably add more work (and more time) for the already overworked advisors and students, and may become a 'tick-the-box' thing (p. 227) with little substance as the authors have pointed out.
>- Chap 8: good discussions on PhD students’ teaching skills; I like what they talk about on p. 250—I hope we can allow and train our PhD students to design and convene a course in addition to being TAs and guest lecturers; I don’t like the approach on p. 257 (more courses and workshops)—I do believe that the best way is learning by doing; p. 263 offers a good summary and I like to ‘open it up’ for students to take opportunities beyond their own department and university.
>- Chap 9: it’s an interesting chapter and I love the idea of a professional master degree in the humanities and humanistic social science (like the existing MFA degree in film production, in addition to MA in film studies); I do find it a bit disturbing that the authors seem to think the only value of a doctoral dissertation is for an academic career; I believe that the very process of devising, planning, carrying out, and completing a multi-year project helps with skill development that won’t be possible through a series of much smaller projects; if done right, the dissertation still offers great value in PhD training.
>- Chap 10: again, an interesting chapter; I like their discussion on p. 297—my take is that, if you are productive in producing scholarship, then you should also be productive in writing op-eds (quality and speed are both important in academic productivity); besides, if you are invited to write op-eds based on your research, you should be somewhat established in your field; finally, the rest of the chapter is also great, and other forms of public scholarship I can add include universal open-access publication/self-archiving, open-source software, open data, and book-writing for the general public.  
>
>Overall, it’s a nice book on an important and perhaps urgent topic, although it’s a long read (lots of details) and many time-deprived academics may not have time to read it. Also, the chapters I’ve seen missed international students who are doing PhD in the US and their unique challenges; on a relevant note, the collapse of the academic job market is a problem facing many countries, while the book has missed international perspectives. Last, ‘career diversity’ only seems to mean ‘getting a job’, overlooking student-entrepreneurs who want to start their own business/startup or non-profit.
